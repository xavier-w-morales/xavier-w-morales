# Welcome to my GitHub page! 
Hey there! If you're a known visitor or a wanderer from the web, welcome to my GitHub page! 

## ðŸ’¬ About me ðŸ’¬


### Who am I?
As you may have guessed from my GitHub username, my name is Xavier W. Morales. I'm a Computer Science major currently studying at the Northampton Community College for my associate's degree. This would be my second year attending, leaving only a few semesters before I graduate and transfer over to a four year university where I will further my studies as a software programmer, or in a STEM-related field.

### What are my interests?
My main interest within computer science mainly revolves around software programming. In particular, I enjoy the ability to create fascinating projects and seeing them come to fruitionâ€”especially useful real-world applications like websites or programs that can automate or assist in my workflow. The most exciting part about it is that there's so much to learn in the CS field, so there's many exciting ways of writing a single line of code that could mean the same thing and potentially save loads of time, or perhaps libraries that can be utilized to perform a task much easier instead of having to perform all the guess work yourself. The thing that drives my workflow is my passion for creativity; if you have an idea that you want to see come to life, you can just design it, then program it. The only ceiling within the virtual space is the virtual space itself. 

### Programming languages I've worked with
These are currently all of the programming/scripting languages I've touched so far:
- C
- C++
- C#
- Javascript
- Python
- Lua
- Visual Basic
- HTML5

The programming languages I have the most experience with:
- C/C++
- Lua

### What am I currently working on?
I've had an array of projects that I've started in the past (some simple, some W.I.P., some completed), but due to Covid-19, they've been put on the backburner. To give you a bit of insight, one of my favorite things to do for programming practice is to mod open-source games. When the tools are presented to you, it makes the job a whole lot easier and much more fun to do. One thing I recall working on was a heads-up display in a fan-game based on the DOOM engine which was designed as part of a bigger project. This as a whole exceeded more than 10,000 lines of code, but is also in need of more optimization as this stems back to 2016 when I still lacked experience in some areas. I will get into further detail on this at a later date, but for now, this is just to give you a general idea.

### What is my favorite hobby?
My favorite hobby would definitely have to be anywhere between 3D rendering, art, and programming practice via modding games/level design. I thoroughly enjoy being able to create artwork and collaborate with others through social platforms to see what we can achieve together, and it's most exciting when it all comes together as a result of passion and hardwork. These three would definitely have to fall within my sweet spot.
